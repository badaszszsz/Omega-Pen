# Omega-Pen
March 2016

This is a forked version of Epic Pen, orginally written by Brian Hoary.
You can get an installable version Epic Pen (no source) from here: 
http://epic-pen.com/ in free (personal) or commercial versions.

This is a Windows-only application, based on [WFP](http://www.wpf-tutorial.com/about-wpf/what-is-wpf/) (Windows Presentation Foundation)

* Re-arranges the color pallette
* New icons, created using the free [Metro Studio](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio) from Syncfusion.
* Smoothing of lines in Pen mode using Bezier curves
* New modes added for drawing precise rectangles, arrows and circles

I made changes to the code to support simple shapes that I need
while giving on-line presentations. The arrows in particular are helpful.
